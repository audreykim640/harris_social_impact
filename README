Explorations/brainstorming:

I think it'd be interesting to track one person's movements throughout one weekday (since weekends are a little less predictable for many people who work).

Since we have ground truth, we can also train a supervise machine learning algorithm. I will have to remember how to do this. [Later] Having now refreshed myself, I'm not sure how to train an algorithm given that it's based on patterns that are distinct for each person. Maybe I'll return to this, but for now, I will try manual labelling and see how accurately it turns out. [Even later] Trying to figure this out would've gone beyond the scope of this assessment. 

Thought process: 

Understanding that the majority (although not all) people who work work during the day, we can tentatively and roughly assume that the person's most frequent location in the nighttime hours (12am-5am) are their home. There might be some folks who work nightshifts, which complicates things. 

Perhaps to account for this, we can instead look at the length of time folks spend at work vs at home. Most full-time work shifts are 8-10 hours, and if people spend all of their other time at home, that's a nice split between 10 working vs 14 home hours per day on weekdays. However, some people work 12 hours shifts, so then we may have to defer to where they spend their days off -- hopefully at home (for data's and their rest's sake) but possibly running errands.

Perhaps we can assume that the location at which one spends the most amount of time is their home, looking at all of the hours of the week cumulatively. Combining non-working hours on working days as well as hours on non-working days (even if they're running errands) will likely result in this assumption being true for most people. We will also assume that folks are not on vacation to another part of the city during the weekend, as that could tip the balances to make the most frequented location for full-time folks their workplace.

Now we need to define what a "place" is. Person 0's common locations are clusters of positions, but they're not staying in the exact same location/coordinates all the time. I could round, but rounding to the nearest integer might group distinct locations. 

After looking at a small sample of 10 people, it seems like even people who work close to home (like person 197) still move enough for the coordinates to round to a different integer. There still could be people who work within one coordinate point to their home, but I don't know how to account for this at this time. 

People 177 and 190 are both unemployed and spend most of their time in their home, and this is likely true for many unemployed people, assuming everyone in this dataset is housed.

Assumptions:
- We are given the assumption that no one works from home. Yay!

- While we can figure out days of the week, not everyone works M-F, so I'm going to keep the weeks' hours cumulative and not try to assess weekends separately from weekdays.

- Assume part-time < 30 hours and full-time is 30+.

- Assume that full-time workers don't additionally work part-time and/or that full-time work trumps part-time work when labeling.

- Assume that no one who works part-time works in two separate locations.

- Assume that folks who aren't working full-time and who spend at least 15 hours in the same non-home place are working part-time at that location (rather than having a dedicated hobby).

- Assume everyone has a stable living location during this 7-day period.

- Assume locations the boundaries of the four districts can be assigned to the nearest district (e.g., someone at (-0.1, 3) can be said to be in the Southwestern district)
